# FFT Image Processing

This project demonstrates image filtering techniques in the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The project explores three types of filters: smoothing, edge detection, and sharpening, by manipulating the FFT mask and applying inverse transforms to observe the effect on images.

## Project Structure

- **Smoothing Filter**: Applies a low-pass filter to blur the image.
- **Edge Detection Filter**: Uses a high-pass filter to highlight edges in the image.
- **Sharpening Filter**: Applies a mask that enhances high-frequency components for image sharpening.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
